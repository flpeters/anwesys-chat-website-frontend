This is the frontend of a web application delevoped as part of a course at TU-Berlin.
The specification was given to us by our professor. Our job was to first create the frontend, with the backend provided by the TU. And then create the backend aswell, using our frontend to test that everything is working as intended.

For part one we had 4.5 weeks to complete our work and for part 2 we had 2.5 weeks.

For this website to work, a server has to be online. Once we finish our work, a java implementation of the server will be available in another repository. At the very top of /js/script.js one can change the ip adress of the backend server.

To use this website, simply open index.html in a web browser and make sure that the backend is reachable.
